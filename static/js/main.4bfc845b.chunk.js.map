Customer data often comes in the form of a list of\r\n        transactions, and typically a Design Technologist would build a custom\r\n        React prototype to display this data.

After experimenting with Figma plugins in a hackathon, I was\r\n        eager to develop the first Figma plugin for Intuit designers.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        A design hurdle I wanted to tackle was supporting theming, particularly\r\n        dark mode. Dark mode has been a work in progress for Intuit design for\r\n        some time and is currently an experimental beta setting for QuickBooks.\r\n        Dark mode is a priority because it is a feature our users expect, and\r\n        also has accessibility benefits such as better contrast and reduced eye\r\n        strain. As this feature becomes more used, we need to make sure that\r\n        designs will work for both light and dark modes.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img src={`${imgPrefix}1.gif`} alt=\"Dark mode demo\" />\r\n      <p>\r\n        I created a simple UI that would allow users to toggle both layers and\r\n        pages between light and dark mode. I also included a color inspector\r\n        that would display the fill and border colors for a selected layer and\r\n        show their light and dark mode pairings.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img src={`${imgPrefix}2.png`} alt=\"Plugin interface\" />\r\n      <p className=\"caption\">\r\n        Inspecting a dark mode design to see the color pairings.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Once I had a solid design, I moved on to developing the functionality\r\n        using <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/\">TypeScript</a> and{\" \"}\r\n        <a href=\"https://sass-lang.com/\">Sass</a>.

We combined all three plugins to make it\r\n        easy for designers to access all of our tools at once.

The plugin now has now been installed by 238 users,\r\n        roughly 2/3 of our total designers.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <hr className=\"contentDivider\" />\r\n      <h2 class=\"sectionTitle\">Version 2</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        After the successful launch of the plugin, I paused development for\r\n        several months to collect analytics and user feedback. In December 2021,\r\n        I created a plan to add more functionality to the plugin. I wanted to\r\n        target three key areas:\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h4>Opportunity #1: Refresh the plugin design</h4>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The first version of this plugin had features that were designed by\r\n        separate teams and lacked a common visual language. The design of the\r\n        plugin did not support multiple modes of navigation. It was likely that\r\n        we would need the flexibility to develop more complex UIs in the future.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h4>Opportunity #2: Contextualize analytics data</h4>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Adding analytics to a Figma plugin can be a bit of a challenge. Since it\r\n        is contained within an iFrame, there is no access to certain information\r\n        most analytics tools need. For the first launch, I developed a simple\r\n        click counting system for the buttons in the plugin. While this did help\r\n        me understand which buttons were being used the most, it lacked the\r\n        contextual data. Which user clicked, and in what file, and at what time?\r\n        I needed this information to make data-driven decisions about the future\r\n        of the plugin.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h4>Opportunity #3: Add a requested feature</h4>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Currently, the most used feature within the plugin is the content\r\n        generator. My team did user research to get feedback on this feature and\r\n        found that a common ask from designers was a way to generate numbers.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h4>Tackling opportunities</h4>\r\n      <p>\r\n        I started by redesigning the plugin to create a common visual language.\r\n        I chose to use{\" \"}\r\n        <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/928108847914589057\">\r\n          UI2, Figma's Design System\r\n        </a>{\" \"}\r\n        as the basis for my design. Using Figma's components and styles helps\r\n        the plugin blend into Figma's UI and seem like a more natural extension\r\n        of its capabilities. I also changed the plugin navigation system to\r\n        include a flyout menu. Moving page navigation into the flyout menu gave\r\n        each feature room for its own navigational elements.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img src={`${imgPrefix}/Redesign.png`} alt=\"Redesign before and after\" />\r\n      <p className=\"caption\">\r\n        Selection of redesigned screens before (left) and after (right)\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img src={`${imgPrefix}/Cover.png`} alt=\"Cover art\" />\r\n      <p className=\"caption\">Redesigned cover art for installation page</p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        My next step was to add analytics. I chose to use{\" \"}\r\n        <a href=\"https://mixpanel.com/\">Mixpanel</a> because of its powerful\r\n        capabilities and compatibility with Figma plugins. Now, when a user\r\n        clicks a button I know their name, the file they are using, and their\r\n        overall activity. I can track monthly active users, view a list of Figma\r\n        files the plugin is being used in, and see which buttons are clicked the\r\n        most. This will help me know which features of the plugin are most\r\n        valuable and should be invested in. I now know who the top users of the\r\n        plugin are and can ask them for feedback.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img\r\n        src={`${imgPrefix}/Mixpanel.png`}\r\n        alt=\"Mixpanel Analytics Dashboard\"\r\n      />\r\n      <p className=\"caption\">\r\n        <a href=\"https://mixpanel.com/public/7veU4Lv7JycMp3Ene9z4hu\">\r\n          Mixpanel Analytics dashboard\r\n        </a>{\" \"}\r\n        with three weeks of data\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Next, I worked on the random number generation feature. QuickBooks\r\n        designers often create data tables with transactional information such\r\n        as dates, percentages, and currency values so I wanted to include all of\r\n        these options in this feature.

Tile\r\n        assets can be a list of TV or movie categories, sports games, local\r\n        news, and more. Designers need to verify text translations for each\r\n        tile, which can involve generating 100+ tiles at a time. Tile images\r\n        must be compressed and follow a naming convention before handing off to\r\n        engineers.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <img src={`${imgPrefix}2.png`} alt=\"Example tiles\" />\r\n      <p className=\"caption\">Example of tiles Roku designers generate</p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        My first thought when hearing about these issues was that a Figma plugin\r\n        could be a perfect fit to automate many of these tasks. The advantage to\r\n        using Figma is that designers can keep their work in one tool, and have\r\n        the functionality they need to customize assets.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        When starting my design process I chose to use{\" \"}\r\n        <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/928108847914589057\">\r\n          UI2, Figma's Design System\r\n        </a>\r\n        . I learned from previous experience building plugins that they felt\r\n        more integrated with Figma when they used the same design system. I\r\n        chose to swap Figma's traditional blue accent with an electric purple to\r\n        give it a Roku-themed flair.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        The first challenge was understanding the process designers go through\r\n        to customize each tile. I wanted to make bulk generation a \"one-click\"\r\n        experience but found it didn't work with the designer's workflows. Each\r\n        tile has to be customized - the color changed or an icon repositioned.\r\n        It didn't make sense to generate 100 tiles all at once if the designer\r\n        would have to go back and tweak each tile. I shifted my mindset to\r\n        thinking of it as \"applying a transformation\" to tiles in a multi-step\r\n        process.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <img src={`${imgPrefix}3.png`} alt=\"User flow\" />\r\n      <p className=\"caption\">Planning the tile generation flow</p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        The next step was to design the export experience. My design\r\n        stakeholders requested that I limit the export customizations to\r\n        simplify the process. With that direction, I added settings for image\r\n        resolutions, formats, and folder naming.

Their design\r\n        team has fewer than 10 designers to support these tools, leaving a\r\n        design gap. Product managers try to fill this gap but find Figma hard to\r\n        use for design work. Additionally, they are often limited to using only\r\n        FigJam due to licensing costs. My team developed a Figma plugin to allow\r\n        non-designers to self-serve simple layouts.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        We focused on generating a commonly used page template with a data table\r\n        as the MVP for this tool. Users can fill out a form to generate a table\r\n        page and specify the components they want to use in the layout. They can\r\n        customize how many columns the table has and what the data type of each\r\n        column should be. They can also add components such as tabs, a search\r\n        bar, breadcrumb navigation, and more.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <img src={`${imgPrefix}/2.png`} alt=\"Creating a table\" />\r\n      <p className=\"caption\">Creating a table</p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        When a template is created, the plugin adds documentation next to it. It\r\n        provides a short explanation of how to use the plugin and where to get\r\n        help. The documentation itself is a published Figma component the plugin\r\n        imports. This way, designers can update the documentation without\r\n        developer support.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <img src={`${imgPrefix}/3.png`} alt=\"Documentation\" />\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        Users can update template layouts as needed. The update process uses the\r\n        current selection to populate the form data in the UI.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <img src={`${imgPrefix}/4.png`} alt=\"Updating a table\" />\r\n      <p className=\"caption\">Updating a table</p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        I created a short demo video of the plugin to share our MVP with new\r\n        users.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <video controls preload=\"none\" poster={`${imgPrefix}1.png`}>\r\n        <source src={`${imgPrefix}Demo.mp4`} type=\"video/mp4\" />\r\n      </video>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        As the plugin gains more users, it's helpful to have analytics to tell\r\n        us how they use the tool. We want to know who the users are, if they're\r\n        using Figma or FigJam, what they are creating and how often. It's also\r\n        important to know if they run into errors. I chose{\" \"}\r\n        <a href=\"https://mixpanel.com/\">Mixpanel</a> to handle our analytics\r\n        because it's easy to use and integrates well with Figma plugins.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <img\r\n        src={`${imgPrefix}/Mixpanel.png`}\r\n        alt=\"Mixpanel Analytics Dashboard\"\r\n      />\r\n      <p className=\"caption\">\r\n        <a href=\"https://mixpanel.com/public/6fPuCsME2BR7Ra7NECbdgx\">\r\n          Mixpanel Analytics dashboard\r\n        </a>{\" \"}\r\n        with preliminary data.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        This plugin was built with React, TypeScript, and Material UI\r\n        components. I wanted to make the code as easy as possible for any future\r\n        developers. Due to my short-term contract, I wouldn't be there to\r\n        onboard them in the future. I focused on creating great documentation,\r\n        commenting code, and writing unit tests. I chose{\" \"}\r\n        <a href=\"https://www.notion.so/\">Notion</a> to host documentation on the\r\n        code base and our publication process. I wrote thorough{\" \"}\r\n        <a href=\"https://jsdoc.app/\">JSDoc</a> comments for all the functions in\r\n        our codebase. I used <a href=\"https://jestjs.io/\">Jest</a> to write 45\r\n        unit tests that automatically ran on pull requests.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        A pain point of creating Figma plugins is that the publishing process is\r\n        manual and you have to upload code in the Figma editor. To work around\r\n        this I used <a href=\"https://github.com/parrot-global/figcd\">figcd</a>,\r\n        a command-line Figma plugin publishing tool. I combined it with GitHub\r\n        Actions to deploy releases, which took a multi-step process to one click\r\n        of a button.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        The NBCUX Self-Service Figma plugin launched in January 2024.\r\n        Development work is now paused while more support and funding is\r\n        gathered for the plugin. In the future, the plugin will include more\r\n        libraries (Angular, React, and Salesforce), templates, and components.\r\n      </p>\r\n    </>\r\n  ),\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default NBCUX;\r\n","import IEPShell from \"./IEPShell\";\r\nimport Pyro from \"./Pyro\";\r\nimport Toolkit from \"./Toolkit\";\r\nimport Flow from \"./Flow\";\r\nimport Puffin from \"./Puffin\";\r\nimport Oso from \"./Oso\";\r\nimport UXE from \"./UXE\";\r\nimport BrandRefresh from \"./BrandRefresh\";\r\nimport NBCUX from \"./NBCUX\";\r\n\r\nconst ProjectsList = [\r\n  NBCUX,\r\n  Flow,\r\n  Puffin,\r\n  BrandRefresh,\r\n  Oso,\r\n  UXE,\r\n  Toolkit,\r\n  Pyro,\r\n  IEPShell,\r\n];\r\n\r\nexport default ProjectsList;\r\n","import React, { useState } from \"react\";\r\nimport { FaLock, FaExclamationCircle } from \"react-icons/fa\";\r\nimport \"./PasswordProtector.scss\";\r\n\r\nconst PasswordProtector = ({ authenticate = () => {} }) => {\r\n  const [userInput, setUserInput] = useState(\"\");\r\n  const [showError, setShowError] = useState(false);\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"passwordContainer\">\r\n      <FaLock className=\"passwordIcon\" />\r\n      <p className=\"body2\">\r\n        Sorry, the information in this project is confidential and requires a\r\n        password.

They also rearranged some of the navigation content based on\r\n        feedback from their users.

Customer data often comes in the form of a list of\r\n        transactions, and typically a Design Technologist would build a custom\r\n        React prototype to display this data. We added an editable table\r\n        component to Pyro that allows designers to upload user data as a CSV,\r\n        saving us all time!\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img src={`${imgPrefix}4.png`} alt=\"Table component\" />\r\n      <p>\r\n        Once Pyro was close to being ready for release, a teammate and I\r\n        conducted ten user testing sessions with Intuit designers.

After experimenting with Figma plugins in a hackathon, I was\r\n        eager to develop the first Figma plugin for Intuit designers.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        A design hurdle I wanted to tackle was supporting theming, particularly\r\n        dark mode. Dark mode has been a work in progress for Intuit design for\r\n        some time and is currently an experimental beta setting for QuickBooks.\r\n        Dark mode is a priority because it is a feature our users expect, and\r\n        also has accessibility benefits such as better contrast and reduced eye\r\n        strain. As this feature becomes more used, we need to make sure that\r\n        designs will work for both light and dark modes.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img src={`${imgPrefix}1.gif`} alt=\"Dark mode demo\" />\r\n      <p>\r\n        I created a simple UI that would allow users to toggle both layers and\r\n        pages between light and dark mode. I also included a color inspector\r\n        that would display the fill and border colors for a selected layer and\r\n        show their light and dark mode pairings.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img\r\n        src={`${imgPrefix}2.png`}\r\n        className=\"withCaption\"\r\n        alt=\"Plugin interface\"\r\n      />\r\n      <p className=\"body2 caption\">\r\n        Inspecting a dark mode design to see the color pairings.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Once I had a solid design, I moved on to developing the functionality\r\n        using <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/\">TypeScript</a> and{\" \"}\r\n        <a href=\"https://sass-lang.com/\">Sass</a>.

We combined all three plugins to make it\r\n        easy for designers to access all of our tools at once. I led the merge\r\n        effort and refactored our code to use the same visual style and coding\r\n        standards.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Version 1 of this plugin was released to the QuickBooks design community\r\n        in April 2021. The plugin now has now been installed by 238 users,\r\n        roughly 2/3 of our total designers.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <hr className=\"contentDivider\" />\r\n      <h2 class=\"sectionTitle\">Version 2</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        After the successful launch of the plugin, I paused development for\r\n        several months to collect analytics and user feedback. In December 2021,\r\n        I created a plan to add more functionality to the plugin. I wanted to\r\n        target three key areas:\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h4>Opportunity #1: Refresh the plugin design</h4>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The first version of this plugin had features that were designed by\r\n        separate teams and lacked a common visual language. The design of the\r\n        plugin did not support multiple modes of navigation. It was likely that\r\n        we would need the flexibility to develop more complex UIs in the future.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h4>Opportunity #2: Contextualize analytics data</h4>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Adding analytics to a Figma plugin can be a bit of a challenge. Since it\r\n        is contained within an iFrame, there is no access to certain information\r\n        most analytics tools need. For the first launch, I developed a simple\r\n        click counting system for the buttons in the plugin. While this did help\r\n        me understand which buttons were being used the most, it lacked the\r\n        contextual data. Which user clicked, and in what file, and at what time?\r\n        I needed this information to make data-driven decisions about the future\r\n        of the plugin.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h4>Opportunity #3: Add a requested feature</h4>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Currently, the most used feature within the plugin is the content\r\n        generator. My team did user research to get feedback on this feature and\r\n        found that a common ask from designers was a way to generate numbers.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h4>Tackling opportunities</h4>\r\n      <p>\r\n        I started by redesigning the plugin to create a common visual language.\r\n        I chose to use{\" \"}\r\n        <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/928108847914589057\">\r\n          UI2, Figma's Design System\r\n        </a>{\" \"}\r\n        as the basis for my design. Using Figma's components and styles helps\r\n        the plugin blend into Figma's UI and seem like a more natural extension\r\n        of its capabilities. I also changed the plugin navigation system to\r\n        include a flyout menu. Moving page navigation into the flyout menu gave\r\n        each feature room for its own navigational elements.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img\r\n        src={`${imgPrefix}/Redesign.png`}\r\n        alt=\"Redesign before and after\"\r\n        className=\"withCaption\"\r\n      />\r\n      <p className=\"body2 caption\">\r\n        Selection of redesigned screens before (left) and after (right)\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img\r\n        src={`${imgPrefix}/Cover.png`}\r\n        alt=\"Cover art\"\r\n        className=\"withCaption\"\r\n      />\r\n      <p className=\"body2 caption\">\r\n        Redesigned cover art for installation page\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        My next step was to add analytics. I chose to use{\" \"}\r\n        <a href=\"https://mixpanel.com/\">Mixpanel</a> because of its powerful\r\n        capabilities and compatibility with Figma plugins. Now, when a user\r\n        clicks a button I know their name, the file they are using, and their\r\n        overall activity. I can track monthly active users, view a list of Figma\r\n        files the plugin is being used in, and see which buttons are clicked the\r\n        most. This will help me know which features of the plugin are most\r\n        valuable and should be invested in. I now know who the top users of the\r\n        plugin are and can ask them for feedback.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img\r\n        src={`${imgPrefix}/Mixpanel.png`}\r\n        alt=\"Mixpanel Analytics Dashboard\"\r\n        className=\"withCaption\"\r\n      />\r\n      <p className=\"body2 caption\">\r\n        <a href=\"https://mixpanel.com/public/7veU4Lv7JycMp3Ene9z4hu\">\r\n          Mixpanel Analytics dashboard\r\n        </a>{\" \"}\r\n        with three weeks of data\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Next, I worked on the random number generation feature.

Tile\r\n        assets can be a list of TV or movie categories, sports games, local\r\n        news, and more. Designers need to verify text translations for each\r\n        tile, which can involve generating 100+ tiles at a time.

The advantage to\r\n        using Figma is that designers can keep their work in one tool, and have\r\n        the functionality they need to customize assets.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        When starting my design process I chose to use{\" \"}\r\n        <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/928108847914589057\">\r\n          UI2, Figma's Design System\r\n        </a>\r\n        .

I wanted to make bulk generation a \"one-click\"\r\n        experience but found it didn't work with the designer's workflows. Each\r\n        tile has to be customized - the color changed or an icon repositioned.\r\n        It didn't make sense to generate 100 tiles all at once if the designer\r\n        would have to go back and tweak each tile.

With that direction, I added settings for image\r\n        resolutions, formats, and folder naming.

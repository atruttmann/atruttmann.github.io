After experimenting with Figma plugins in a hackathon, I was\r\n        eager to develop the first Figma plugin for Intuit designers.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        A design hurdle I wanted to tackle was supporting theming, particularly\r\n        dark mode. Dark mode has been a work in progress for Intuit design for\r\n        some time and is currently an experimental beta setting for QuickBooks.\r\n        Dark mode is a priority because it is a feature our users expect, and\r\n        also has accessibility benefits such as better contrast and reduced eye\r\n        strain. As this feature becomes more used, we need to make sure that\r\n        designs will work for both light and dark modes.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img src={`${imgPrefix}1.gif`} alt=\"Dark mode demo\" />\r\n      <p>\r\n        I created a simple UI that would allow users to toggle both layers and\r\n        pages between light and dark mode. I also included a color inspector\r\n        that would display the fill and border colors for a selected layer and\r\n        show their light and dark mode pairings.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img\r\n        src={`${imgPrefix}2.png`}\r\n        className=\"withCaption\"\r\n        alt=\"Plugin interface\"\r\n      />\r\n      <p className=\"body2 caption\">\r\n        Inspecting a dark mode design to see the color pairings.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Once I had a solid design, I moved on to developing the functionality\r\n        using <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/\">Typescript</a> and{\" \"}\r\n        <a href=\"https://sass-lang.com/\">Sass</a>. The plugin analyzes a layer's\r\n        fill and border colors, finding the appropriate contextual color\r\n        pairing, and then changing the layer's colors to the new theme.This\r\n        automatic process is completed in a matter of seconds, which saves\r\n        designers hours of work in manually changing colors.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <video className=\"withCaption\" controls preload=\"none\">\r\n        <source src={`${imgPrefix}Demo.mp4`} type=\"video/mp4\" />\r\n      </video>\r\n      <p className=\"body2 caption\">\r\n        This quick demo of Dark Mode that appeared within a QB Designer Toolkit\r\n        instructional video I created.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Design Technologists on my team also created two other plugins that\r\n        focus on motion and content. We combined all three plugins to make it\r\n        easy for designers to access all of our tools at once. I led the merge\r\n        effort and refactored our code to use the same visual style and coding\r\n        standards.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Version 1 of this plugin was released to the QuickBooks design community\r\n        in April 2021. The plugin now has now been installed by 238 users,\r\n        roughly 2/3 of our total designers.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <hr className=\"contentDivider\" />\r\n      <h2 class=\"sectionTitle\">Version 2</h2>\r\n      <p>\r\n        After the successful launch of the plugin, I paused development for\r\n        several months to collect analytics and user feedback. In December 2021,\r\n        I created a plan to add more functionality to the plugin. I wanted to\r\n        target three key areas:\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h4>Opportunity #1: Refresh the plugin design</h4>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The first version of this plugin had features that were designed by\r\n        separate teams and lacked a common visual language. The design of the\r\n        plugin did not support multiple modes of navigation. It was likely that\r\n        we would need the flexibility to develop more complex UIs in the future.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h4>Opportunity #2: Contextualize analytics data</h4>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Adding analytics to a Figma plugin can be a bit of a challenge. Since it\r\n        is contained within an iFrame, there is no access to certain information\r\n        most analytics tools need. For the first launch, I developed a simple\r\n        click counting system for the buttons in the plugin. While this did help\r\n        me understand which buttons were being used the most, it lacked the\r\n        contextual data. Which user clicked, and in what file, and at what time?\r\n        I needed this information to make data-driven decisions about the future\r\n        of the plugin.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h4>Opportunity #3: Add a requested feature</h4>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Currently, the most used feature within the plugin is the content\r\n        generator. My team did user research to get feedback on this feature and\r\n        found that a common ask from designers was a way to generate numbers.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h4>Tackling opportunities</h4>\r\n      <p>\r\n        I started by redesigning the plugin to create a common visual language.\r\n        I chose to use{\" \"}\r\n        <a href=\"https://www.figma.com/community/file/928108847914589057\">\r\n          UI2, Figma's Design System\r\n        </a>{\" \"}\r\n        as the basis for my design. Using Figma's components and styles helps\r\n        the plugin blend into Figma's UI and seem like a more natural extension\r\n        of its capabilities. I also changed the plugin navigation system to\r\n        include a flyout menu. Moving page navigation into the flyout menu gave\r\n        each feature room for its own navigational elements.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img\r\n        src={`${imgPrefix}/Redesign.png`}\r\n        alt=\"Redesign before and after\"\r\n        className=\"withCaption\"\r\n      />\r\n      <p className=\"body2 caption\">\r\n        Selection of redesigned screens before (left) and after (right)\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img\r\n        src={`${imgPrefix}/Cover.png`}\r\n        alt=\"Cover art\"\r\n        className=\"withCaption\"\r\n      />\r\n      <p className=\"body2 caption\">\r\n        Redesigned cover art for installation page\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        My next step was to add analytics. I chose to use{\" \"}\r\n        <a href=\"https://mixpanel.com/\">Mixpanel</a> because of its powerful\r\n        capabilities and compatibility with Figma plugins. Now, when a user\r\n        clicks a button I know their name, the file they are using, and their\r\n        overall activity. I can track monthly active users, view a list of Figma\r\n        files the plugin is being used in, and see which buttons are clicked the\r\n        most. This will help me know which features of the plugin are most\r\n        valuable and should be invested in. I now know who the top users of the\r\n        plugin are and can ask them for feedback.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img\r\n        src={`${imgPrefix}/Mixpanel.png`}\r\n        alt=\"Mixpanel Analytics Dashboard\"\r\n        className=\"withCaption\"\r\n      />\r\n      <p className=\"body2 caption\">\r\n        <a href=\"https://mixpanel.com/public/7veU4Lv7JycMp3Ene9z4hu\">\r\n          Mixpanel Analytics dashboard\r\n        </a>{\" \"}\r\n        with three weeks of data\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Next, I worked on the random number generation feature. QuickBooks\r\n        designers often create data tables with transactional information such\r\n        as dates, percentages, and currency values so I wanted to include all of\r\n        these options in this feature. This feature has the flexibility to add\r\n        one number or a range of numbers, with options to sort the range. This\r\n        will reduce the work a designer has to do filling out a table from\r\n        minutes to seconds.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img\r\n        src={`${imgPrefix}/Number.png`}\r\n        alt=\"Random number generator\"\r\n        className=\"withCaption\"\r\n      />\r\n      <p className=\"body2 caption\">\r\n        The UI allows users to customize the format of numbers, currencies, and\r\n        dates\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Version 2 is an active work in progress that I anticipate finishing\r\n        within the next month. One of the biggest challenges in creating an\r\n        internal tool is driving adoption, and I plan to do this by promoting\r\n        the plugin to designers in a series of demo sessions.\r\n      </p>\r\n    </>\r\n  ),\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default Toolkit;\r\n","import getImgPrefix from \"../util/getImgPrefix\";\r\n\r\nconst imgFolder = \"VideoGameOlympics\";\r\nconst imgPrefix = getImgPrefix(imgFolder);\r\n\r\nconst VideoGameOlympics = {\r\n  title: \"Video Game Olympics\",\r\n  subTitle: \"Personal project using Google Sheets API\",\r\n  coverImageSrc: `${imgPrefix}/1.png`,\r\n  coverPosition: \"top center\",\r\n  passwordRequired: false,\r\n  overview: {\r\n    problem:\r\n      \"How can we display data from a video game tournament in real time?\",\r\n    goal: \"Create a website that pulls live data from a Google spreadsheet to display a leaderboard and challenges list.\",\r\n    role: \"I designed and developed this website as a personal project.\",\r\n    dates: \"September - October 2021\",\r\n  },\r\n  links: [\r\n    {\r\n      title: \"Video Game Olympics website\",\r\n      url: \"https://alaynatruttmann.com/video-game-olympics/\",\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      title: \"GitHub repository\",\r\n      url: \"https://github.com/atruttmann/video-game-olympics\",\r\n    },\r\n  ],\r\n  content: (\r\n    <>\r\n      <p>\r\n        I was inspired to work on this project by my partner, who hosted a video\r\n        game tournament where his friends would complete challenges for points.\r\n        While the event was happening, he wanted to show players a countdown\r\n        timer, a leaderboard, and a list of challenges. In the background, my\r\n        partner would review challenge submissions and enter player scores in a\r\n        spreadsheet.

Since this data needed to update as the\r\n        spreadsheet was edited, I refreshed the data every five seconds.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Players earned points by doing challenges. The relevant data they needed\r\n        to know was the challenge description and how many points were up for\r\n        grabs. A maximum of three players could score for each challenge, so\r\n        challenges that were no longer available were grayed out.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img src={`${imgPrefix}2.png`} alt=\"Challenges\" />\r\n      <p>\r\n        This website was built with a responsive design. I expected most players\r\n        to view the site on their laptops, but they had the option of viewing it\r\n        on their phone (or any device) if they preferred. Any overflowing\r\n        content in the tables can be accessed by scrolling horizontally.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <div className=\"twoImg\">\r\n        <img src={`${imgPrefix}3.png`} alt=\"Viewed on phone\" />\r\n        <img src={`${imgPrefix}4.png`} alt=\"Viewed on tablet\" />\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p>\r\n        At the end of the tournament, the countdown was replaced with a message\r\n        declaring the winner.

It could be sorted differently, or maxed out challenges\r\n        could be hidden.

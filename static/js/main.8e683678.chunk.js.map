One or more players can run the Dixma plugin within\r\n        Figma to start the game and control the gameplay.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img src={`${imgPrefix}2.png`} alt=\"Players adding names to list\" />\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        When the first round starts, each player gets a page created within the\r\n        Figma document. This page holds the six cards they have in their hand\r\n        each round. This is also where they can submit cards and voting tokens\r\n        to the main game board. Players are on the honor system to not look at\r\n        other player's pages.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img src={`${imgPrefix}3.png`} alt=\"Player's hand\" />\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        Each round, one player is the storyteller and gives a short clue to\r\n        describe a card in their deck. All other players submit a card that they\r\n        think best matches the clue. Once everyone has submitted, the player\r\n        controlling the plugin reveals the cards in the \"Card Play Area\".\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img src={`${imgPrefix}4.png`} alt=\"Cards moved to 'Card Play Area'\" />\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        Next, players look at the cards played and vote for the card they think\r\n        fits with the clue given. Players must determine their scores and move\r\n        their tokens on the game board. The next round begins and rounds\r\n        continue until someone reaches 30 points.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img src={`${imgPrefix}5.png`} alt=\"Players voting\" />\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        This plugin was written in Typescript and was primarily developed over\r\n        two days. I had never used Typescript or created a Figma plugin before\r\n        so it was a rapid learning process! If I were to continue working on\r\n        this, I would consider adding automatic scoring.

Intuit\r\n        Experts) to assist customers. In this portal Experts can see customer\r\n        data while on a call and also manage personal work information such as\r\n        their schedule and notes.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        The focus for this prototype was updating the \"shell\" of the product -\r\n        the left, top, and right navigation elements. The design team wanted to\r\n        refresh the components and visual design to align with Intuit Design\r\n        Systems. They also rearranged some of the navigation content based on\r\n        feedback from their users. The inner content was not finalized for this\r\n        phase of prototyping so a responsive column layout was used as a\r\n        placeholder.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img src={`${imgPrefix}1.png`} alt=\"The Intuit Export Portal Shell\" />\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        The functionality required for this prototype was to be able to click\r\n        through the left navigation items and open and close the right drawer.\r\n        The \"Engagements\" screen needed to show a header and tabs with client\r\n        information. Navigation elements also had to behave responsively on\r\n        smaller screens.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <video className=\"withCaption\" controls muted preload=\"none\">\r\n        <source src={`${imgPrefix}Demo.mp4`} type=\"video/mp4\" />\r\n      </video>\r\n      <p className=\"body2 caption\">\r\n        This video shows the entire flow of the prototype.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        The most challenging development aspect of this project was the\r\n        responsive design of the top navigation. This header included dropdowns,\r\n        links, and other information that needed to be accessible on smaller\r\n        screens. These navigation items needed to collapse into an overflow\r\n        menu.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img\r\n        className=\"withCaption\"\r\n        src={`${imgPrefix}2.png`}\r\n        alt=\"Milestone dropdown when header is not in overflow.\"\r\n      />\r\n      <p className=\"body2 caption\">\r\n        Opening the milestone dropdown when the header is not in an overflow\r\n        state.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <img\r\n        className=\"withCaption\"\r\n        src={`${imgPrefix}3.png`}\r\n        alt=\"Milestone dropdown when header is overflowing.\"\r\n      />\r\n      <p className=\"body2 caption\">\r\n        Accessing the milestone dropdown in an overflow state.\r\n      </p>\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        Another responsive aspect of this screen was the overflow behavior for\r\n        tabs. Tabs needed an arrow to show that there were more tabs hidden.\r\n        When clicked, this arrow needed to scroll the tabs by a set pixel value.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img src={`${imgPrefix}4.png`} alt=\"Tabs in an overflow state\" />\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        After this prototype had been finalized with the design team, I handed\r\n        off the prototype and the code to the development team.

I am trying to save time on repetitive\r\n        accounting tasks, but I am unable to automate any of my work in\r\n        QuickBooks. QuickBooks makes some recommendations, but I don't trust\r\n        them.

Currently in QuickBooks product, a user's\r\n        transactions are separated on different pages by type. This table\r\n        brought all transactions into one place. The design team's hope is that\r\n        showing all transactions in one table will help small businesses get\r\n        immediate value from QuickBooks by using it as a source of truth for\r\n        their finances.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img src={`${imgPrefix}4.png`} alt=\"Transactions table\" />\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        From a development perspective, the transactions table was the most\r\n        complex part of the prototype to create. Every field in the table was\r\n        editable. Data needed to be filtered by type, status, date, and more. It\r\n        also needed to be sortable, groupable, and searchable. I was able to\r\n        leverage several components from Intuit's design system, but there was\r\n        still a lot of custom work to be done.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        I provided each user with a custom link to the prototype that had their\r\n        transactions. It was not necessary to sync changes to the table to a\r\n        backend for this prototype, so any changes a user made were stored in\r\n        their browser.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img src={`${imgPrefix}5.png`} alt=\"Searching the transactions table\" />\r\n\r\n      <p>\r\n        Testing this prototype helped the design team I partnered with gain a\r\n        better understanding of the customer problems around managing\r\n        transactions and automation. It also verified that the improvements\r\n        shown in the prototype would help solve these issues. The reaction from\r\n        users and our design leaders was great, and the project moved forward to\r\n        be built into production.\r\n      </p>\r\n    </>\r\n  ),\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default TransactionsTable;\r\n","const imgFolder = \"SporcleBot\";\r\nconst imgPrefix = `${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}images/${imgFolder}/`;\r\n\r\nconst SporcleBot = {\r\n  title: \"SporcleBot\",\r\n  subTitle: \"Building a Slack Bot\",\r\n  imageFolderName: imgFolder,\r\n  coverImageName: \"Cover\",\r\n  passwordRequired: false,\r\n  links: [],\r\n  overview: [\r\n    {\r\n      title: \"Problem\",\r\n      content:\r\n        \"While we've been working remotely, my team has participated in a Sporcle challenge daily.

The prototype data\r\n        syncs to a <a href=\"https://firebase.google.com/\">Firebase</a> backend.\r\n        Users can grab components from the left-side panel and drag them into\r\n        the editor. When a component is selected, you can edit its properties in\r\n        the right-side panel.

Customer data often comes in the form of a list of\r\n        transactions, and typically a Design Technologist would build a custom\r\n        React prototype to display this data.

After experimenting with Figma plugins in a hackathon, I was\r\n        eager to develop the first Figma plugin for Intuit designers.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        A design hurdle I wanted to tackle was supporting theming, particularly\r\n        dark mode. Dark mode has been a work in progress for Intuit design for\r\n        some time and is currently an experimental beta setting for QuickBooks.\r\n        Dark mode is a priority because it is a feature our users expect, and\r\n        also has accessibility benefits such as better contrast and reduced eye\r\n        strain. As this feature becomes more used, we need to make sure that\r\n        designs will work for both light and dark modes.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img src={`${imgPrefix}1.gif`} alt=\"Dark mode demo\" />\r\n      <p>\r\n        I needed to figure out how to best apply our color pairing rules\r\n        automatically to designs. I started by researching other dark mode Figma\r\n        plugins. I then created a simple UI that would allow users to toggle\r\n        both layers and pages between light and dark mode. I also included a\r\n        color inspector that would display the fill and border colors for a\r\n        selected layer and show their light and dark mode pairings.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img\r\n        src={`${imgPrefix}2.png`}\r\n        className=\"withCaption\"\r\n        alt=\"Plugin interface\"\r\n      />\r\n      <p className=\"body2 caption\">\r\n        Inspecting a dark mode design to see the color pairings.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Once I had a solid design, I moved on to developing the functionality\r\n        using <a href=\"https://www.typescriptlang.org/\">Typescript</a> and{\" \"}\r\n        <a href=\"https://sass-lang.com/\">Sass</a>. The plugin works by analyzing\r\n        a layer's fill and border colors, finding the appropriate contextual\r\n        color pairing, and then changing the layer's colors to the new theme.\r\n        Color style names are saved so no data is lost in the transformation.\r\n        This automatic process is completed in a matter of seconds, which saves\r\n        designers hours of work in manually changing colors.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <video className=\"withCaption\" controls preload=\"none\">\r\n        <source src={`${imgPrefix}Demo.mp4`} type=\"video/mp4\" />\r\n      </video>\r\n      <p className=\"body2 caption\">\r\n        This quick demo of Dark Mode that appeared within a QB Designer Toolkit\r\n        instructional video I created.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Design Technologists on my team also created two other plugins that\r\n        focus on motion and content. We combined all three plugins to make it\r\n        easy for designers to access all of our tools at once. I led the merge\r\n        effort and refactored our code to use the same visual style and coding\r\n        standards.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        We released the plugin to our design community in April 2021. Two months\r\n        after it was released, the plugin has been installed by 181 users. I\r\n        added analytics tracking to buttons within the plugin and wrote a node\r\n        script to summarize this data. This will help us make data-driven design\r\n        decisions as we continue to update and improve the plugin. A possible\r\n        next step would be to allow users to create custom color pairings.\r\n      </p>\r\n    </>\r\n  ),\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default Toolkit;\r\n","import getImgPrefix from \"../util/getImgPrefix\";\r\n\r\nconst imgFolder = \"VideoGameOlympics\";\r\nconst imgPrefix = getImgPrefix(imgFolder);\r\n\r\nconst VideoGameOlympics = {\r\n  title: \"Video Game Olympics\",\r\n  subTitle: \"Personal project using Google Sheets API\",\r\n  coverImageSrc: `${imgPrefix}/1.png`,\r\n  coverPosition: \"top center\",\r\n  passwordRequired: false,\r\n  overview: {\r\n    problem:\r\n      \"How can we display data from a video game tournament in real time?\",\r\n    goal: \"Create a website that pulls live data from a Google spreadsheet to display a leaderboard and challenges list.\",\r\n    role: \"I designed and developed this website as a personal project.\",\r\n    dates: \"September - October 2021\",\r\n  },\r\n  links: [\r\n    {\r\n      title: \"Video Game Olympics website\",\r\n      url: \"https://alaynatruttmann.com/video-game-olympics/\",\r\n    },\r\n    {\r\n      title: \"GitHub repository\",\r\n      url: \"https://github.com/atruttmann/video-game-olympics\",\r\n    },\r\n  ],\r\n  content: (\r\n    <>\r\n      <p>\r\n        I was inspired to work on this project by my partner, who hosted a video\r\n        game tournament where his friends would complete challenges for points.\r\n        While the event was happening, he wanted to show players a countdown\r\n        timer, a leaderboard, and a list of challenges. In the background, my\r\n        partner would review challenge submissions and enter player scores in a\r\n        spreadsheet.

Since this data needed to update as the\r\n        spreadsheet was edited, I refreshed the data every five seconds.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Players earned points by doing challenges. The relevant data they needed\r\n        to know was the challenge description and how many points were up for\r\n        grabs. A maximum of three players could score for each challenge, so\r\n        challenges that were no longer available were grayed out.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <img src={`${imgPrefix}2.png`} alt=\"Challenges\" />\r\n      <p>\r\n        This website was built with a responsive design. I expected most players\r\n        to view the site on their laptops, but they had the option of viewing it\r\n        on their phone (or any device) if they preferred. Any overflowing\r\n        content in the tables can be accessed by scrolling horizontally.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <div className=\"twoImg\">\r\n        <img src={`${imgPrefix}3.png`} alt=\"Viewed on phone\" />\r\n        <img src={`${imgPrefix}4.png`} alt=\"Viewed on tablet\" />\r\n      </div>\r\n      <p>\r\n        At the end of the tournament, the countdown was replaced with a message\r\n        declaring the winner.

It could be sorted differently, or maxed out challenges\r\n        could be hidden.

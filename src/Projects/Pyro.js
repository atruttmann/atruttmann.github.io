      For my Fall 2017 Software Engineering class, I proposed creating an
      Android app that would help dairy farmers record the process of raising
      calves. I came up with this idea from my personal experience growing up on
      a dairy farm. My proposal was in the top 20 of 130+ proposals, and a
      7-person team was formed to create “Calf Tracker”.

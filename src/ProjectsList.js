            For my Fall 2017 Software Engineering class, I proposed creating an
            Android app that would help dairy farmers record the process of
            raising calves. I came up with this idea from my personal experience
            growing up on a dairy farm. My proposal was in the top 20 of 130+
            proposals, and a 7-person team was formed to create “Calf Tracker”.

            In the planning stages of our project, my team went on a customer
            visit to our client Dan Truttmann, the owner of Truttmann Dairy
            Farms. Truttmann Dairy is a family-owned farm in Wisconsin that
            raises 300 calves per year. Dan showed us around the farm and
            explained how he and his employees take care of calves through
            feedings, scheduled vaccinations, and illness monitoring.
